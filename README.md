🗹 # comment and shebang support    
🗹 goo file extension  
🗹 not operator keyword for `!`  
🗹 and, or operators for && || 
🗹 ø keyword for `nil`

🗹 ¬ operator for `!`  
☐ return void, e.g. return print("ok")    
☐ go command should default to run, so go test.go should work  
☐ cross off all done tasks from this list  
☐ print := fmt.Println      
☐ assert / check  
☐ public() -> Public() calls OK  
☐ silent/implicit error propagation      
☐ for loops      
☐ enums via struct    
☐ class via struct  
☐ no Main needed  

☐ any other pain points you and I might have
